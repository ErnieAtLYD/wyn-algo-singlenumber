# Algorithm Cardio: Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Example 1:

```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [1,3,5,7,10,1,3,5,7]
Output: 10
```

### Hints

This is a variation on yesterdays morning exercise. Get it working first. Once you have that, can you get it so there's a linear runtime complexity? Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Running this locally (aka not on glitch)

```
$ yarn
$ code .
$ yarn start
```

When starting your project, the message may say that your app is listening on a different port number than the default Express.js port. Use the different port number when running https://localhost.
